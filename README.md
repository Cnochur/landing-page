The Odin Project - Introduction: Assignment 1 - Landing Page
-------------------------------------------------------------

Intro
-------------------------------------------------------------
Hello there!

My name is Cnochur (pronouced Conor), and this is my first official
assignment for The Odin Project (TOP). The assignment is to build
a landing page using the knowledge that I have gained so far within
TOP. They have provided an image of a layout as a guideline for the 
page. As it is an assignment, I will treat it as professionally as 
I know how to.

Goals
-------------------------------------------------------------
The goals I have for this assignment are:

- Complete the Assignment
- Use clear and understandable code
- Use git to the best of my knowledge
  - Properly committing messages with a title (Less than 50 chars)
    and a precise body of text explaining (less than 72 chars).

- Transform the page into a profile page for me.
